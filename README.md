# Algorithm Visualizer

A better visualization of different algorithms made with React. 

So far there are 6 segments  
- Pathfinder
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Convex Hull
- Binary Search Game
- Recursion Tree

I have implemented a total of `24 algorithms` so far. And will try to add more later.  

## Algorithms implemented 

- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- A star
- Recursive Maze Creation
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Archimedes Spiral
- N Queen Backtracking
- Graham Scan for Convex Hull
- Binary Search
- Recursion
  - Fibonacci Number
  - Binomial Coefficient
  - Derangement
  - Fast Exponentiation
  - Stirling Number of Second Kind

### Acknowledgement

I took inspirations from the following sources for some of the segments.

- `Archimedes Spiral for Primes`: [Why do prime numbers make these spirals? ](https://youtu.be/EK32jo7i5LQ)
